  <h2> Introduction</h2>

  <p>Hi, I’m Shivam Sharma — a MERN full-stack developer passionate about building web applications, clean UI designs, and creative digital projects.</p>
<br><br><hr>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I studied at SKNAU Jobner, where I strengthened my academic foundation and simultaneously started learning web development, eventually moving into MERN full-stack development.</p>
  <br><br><hr>
<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>I have developed a variety of web projects that reflect my skills in both frontend and backend development. My work includes creating website clones, modern UI/UX designs, and full-stack applications using the MERN stack. These projects demonstrate my ability to build responsive interfaces, implement interactive features, and manage backend logic efficiently.

I’ve built website clones of popular platforms to strengthen my understanding of layout structuring, component-based design, and user experience. Alongside this, I have worked on UI design projects, focusing on clean styling, intuitive navigation, and mobile-friendly layouts.

My MERN projects highlight my capability in handling APIs, database operations, authentication, CRUD functionality, and deploying complete applications. Through these projects, I’ve gained hands-on experience with React, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, along with practical knowledge of Git, version control, and modern development workflows.</p>
